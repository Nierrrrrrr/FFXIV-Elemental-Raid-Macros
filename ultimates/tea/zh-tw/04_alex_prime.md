# Alexander Prime

## Outline

The **ST** (not the MT!) will take hate to start this phase. The outline to Alexander Prime looks like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="#temporal-stasis"><b>Temporal Stasis</b></a></td>
    <td><ul><li>Red/green tethers west</li><li>No debuffs east</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Chastening Heat #1 + Divine Spears</b></td>
    <td><ul><li>ST invuln <em>(tank swap after the Divine Spears)</em></li></ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="#inception-formation"><b>Inception Formation</b></a></td>
    <td><ul><li>Flarethrowers:<ul><li>MT south</li><li>ST middle</li></ul></li><li>Tanks + Shared Sentence left</li><li>ST baits Super Jump</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Chastening Heat #2 + Divine Spears</b></td>
    <td><ul><li>MT invuln</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="#wormhole-formation"><b>Wormhole Formation</b></a></td>
    <td><ul><li>09STOP <em>(Korean sim strat)</em></li></ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>2x Mega Holy</b></td>
    <td><ul><li>MT Reprisal, D4</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="#j-waves"><b>J Waves</b></a></td>
    <td><ul><li><b>After 6 stacks:</b> MT90s, ST 90s, H1 120s, H2 120s</li><li><b>After 8 stacks:</b> ST Reprisal, H2 30s, D3</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
</table>

We break down the mechanics below.

## Temporal Stasis

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>No debuff:</b> Go to the <b>east</b> boss.
      <ul><li><b>Tanks/Healers</b>: North</li>
        <li><b>DPS:</b> South</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p><b>Red/Green tether:</b> Go to the <b>west</b> boss about one marker apart.
        <ul><li><b>Tanks/Healers:</b> North</li>
        <li><b>DPS:</b> South</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p><b>Blue tether:</b>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Tanks/Healers:</b> West</li>
          <li><b>DPS:</b> East</li>
        </ul>
        The blue-tether player on Cruise Chaser's side takes a few steps towards Cruise Chaser.
      </p>
      <p><b>Aggravated Assault:</b> Far west/east on the same side as Brute Justice.</p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/temporal_stasis_01.jpg"><img src="../images/alex_prime/temporal_stasis_02.jpg"><img src="../images/alex_prime/temporal_stasis_tethers.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

After Temporal Stasis, the **ST** will take aggro and invuln Alexander Prime's Chastening Heat. **This invuln should be timed** to also absorb the three Divine Spear cleaves that follow.

Alternatively, you can mitigate the Chastening Heat, and invuln the Divine Spears.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Chastening Heat + Divine Spears #1</b></td>
    <td><p>ST invuln.</p><p>Tank swap from ST to MT after the Divine Spears.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

You **can** catch the Chastening Heat and all three Divine Spears with a single invuln, but the timing is tight. Consider using cds to take the Chastening Heat, and then invuln the three Divine Spears (there is an auto-attack in between).

After the Divine Spears, have the MT Provoke and take aggro. Alexander Prime will autoattack twice before casting Inception Formation.

## Inception Formation

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Alexander spawns either True North <em>or</em> True South.</p><ul><li><b>Green tethers:</b> Go towards Alexander, opposite your tethered orb. <b>Criss-cross the tethers</b>.</li><li><b>Crystal AoEs:</b> Make a square formation directly opposite Alexander.</li></ul></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_01.jpg"><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_crystals.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Resolve the Crystal AoEs and the green orbs.</p><p>Note that the residual AoEs will be slightly <b>larger</b> than their telegraphed size.</p><p>The party wipes if any AoEs touch each other.</p><p>Done correctly, the True Heart that spawns opposite Alexander Prime will <b>hit all four crystals</b> and turn gold, giving the party the Enigma Codex buff.</p><p><em>(The Perfect Alexander phase will be <b>impossible</b> without the Enigma Codex.)</em></p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> Move along the edge of the arena to gather along the north wall towards Brute Justice. This is done so players do not die to the crystal's proximity damage.</p><p>When the crystals explode, the MT and ST take up their positions next to Brute Justice to prepare to bait the Flarethrowers.</p><p><em>(Note that the green puddles left behind will slow down movement.)</em></p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> Brute Justice then Flarethrowers the three closest people starting from the nearest.</p><ul><li><b>MT</b>: Bait the first Flarethrower south</li><li><b>ST</b>: Bait the second Flarethrower in the middle.</li><li><b>Everyone else</b>: Stay near the intercardinal edge, but not close to Brute Justice (one person in this group will end up baiting the third Flarethrower).</li></ul></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_04.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>5.</b> The True Heart will now move to a random spot at the edge of the Arena, where Alexander will spawn and cast Sacrament.</p><p>Players will also get various debuffs to resolve.</p><ul><li><b>Tanks:</b> Go left</li><li><b>Healers:</b> Go right</li><li><b>DPS:</b><ul><li><b>Shared Sentence:</b> Go left</li><li><b>Others:</b> Go right</li></ul></li></ul></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>6.</b> Brute Justice will respawn West, and Cruise Chaser will respawn in the middle of the arena.</p><ul><li><b>ST:</b> Far East.</li><li><b>H1:</b> North, near Cruise Chaser.</li><li><b>H2:</b> South, near Cruise Chaser.</li><li><b>DPS that had the blue tether</b>: West, near Cruise Chaser.</li><li><b>Everyone else:</b> East, between Cruise Chaser and the ST <em>(not too close to Cruise Chaser!)</em></li></ul></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_06.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>7.</b> Cruise Chaser will then Alpha Sword the three closest players, which should be the two healers, and the DPS that had the blue tether.</p><p>When Cruise Chaser cleaves either the north or south player, the rest of the party can run behind that player to avoid the incoming Super Jump.</p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_07.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>8.</b> Brute Justice Super Jumps on the furthest player, which should be the ST.</p><p>The impact AoE is quite large, so it's safe for all other players to run away from the ST by the third Alpha Sword.</p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_08.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Alexander Prime will then reappear in the center and begin another Chastening Heat â†’ 3x Divine Spear combo, all of which will be taken by a timed MT invuln.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Chastening Heat + Divine Spears #2</b></td>
    <td><p>MT invuln.</p><p><em>(No tank swap needed after.)</em></p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Alexander Prime then auto-attacks twice and casts Wormhole Formation.

## Wormhole Formation

Wormhole Formation will use 09STOP's method (highlighted by the [Korean simulator](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sdo02A5GbNPA9B4HN-NOt-vnTPyv2elH/view)).

Remember that **all odd numbered players must face outside the arena and use Arm's Length/Surecast** when baiting Cruise Chaser to nullify the knockback from Alpha Sword.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Identify Limit Cut numbers, and stack in the middle of the arena to bait Chakrams.</p><p>Identify where Brute Justice is, as this will determine who baits Super Jump and Apocalyptic Ray (and thus have stricter positioning requirements).</p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Move to positions.</p><ul><li>The person diagonally opposite Brute Justice (3 or 4) should bait Super Jump <b>in front of the red dot.</b></li><li>The person diagonally opposite Cruise Chaser (3 or 4) should go <b>all the way to the edge</b> to dodge Apocalyptic Ray.</li><li><b>1</b> and <b>2</b> use anti-knockback abilities.</li></ul><p><em>(Notice</em> <b>3</b> <em>is</em> slightly <em>further in because they will be baiting Super Jump in this example.</em> <b>4</b> <em> is all the way at the edge.)</em></p></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>5.</b> Players <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> resolve their Void puddles, then take up positions north (where <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> were).</p><p>Cruise Chaser cleaves <b>3</b>.</p><p>Alexander starts charging Sacrament. <em>(do not panic!)</em></p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_05.jpg"></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>11.</b> Party makes three groups near each other in the middle for Incinerating Heat- far enough that it is easy to identify whether a swap is needed for Enumeration, but close enough for all party members to split the Incinerating Heat damage.</p><ul><li><b>D1, D3:</b> Stack a little bit west.</li><li><b>Tanks + Healers:</b> Stack together in the center.</li><li><b>D2, D4:</b> Stack a little bit east.</li></ul></td>

  <tr>

	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_12.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Pair-wise movement

Broken down into the major steps, here's what each pair does. Note that what each pair does is **independent from the rest of the party**, so you can focus on executing your part.

All the action happens north and south. If it's not your turn to do anything, or if you're done, return to the East/West positions.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>1 and 2</b></td>
    <td><ol><li><b>Arm's Length/Surecast when the Chakrams fly.</b></li><li>Resolve Cruise Chaser's cleave (1) and dash (2) north.</li><li>Bait Apocalyptic Ray from Brute Justice.</li><li>Soak <b>third</b> set of puddles.</li></ol></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>3 and 4</b></td>
    <td><ol><li>Bait Super Jump south.</li><li><b>Arm's Length/Surecast when Brute Justice jumps.</b></li><li>Resolve Cruise Chaser's cleave (3) and dash (4) south.</li><li>Dodge Sacrament lasers from Alexander.</li></ol></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>5 and 6</b></td>
    <td><ol><li>Soak <b>first</b> set of puddles.</li><li><b>Arm's Length/Surecast when the puddles resolve.</b></li><li>Resolve Cruise Chaser's cleave (5) and dash (6) north.</li></ol></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>7 and 8</b></td>
    <td><ol><li>Soak <b>second</b> set of puddles.</li><li><b>Arm's Length/Surecast when the puddles resolve.</b></li><li>Resolve Cruise Chaser's cleave (7) and dash (8) south.</li></ol></td>
  </tr>
</table>

After the Enumeration at the end of Wormhole Formation, Alexander Prime will respawn back in the center of the arena and cast two Mega Holies back-to-back.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Mega Holy x2</b></td>
    <td><p>MT Reprisal, H2 30s, D1, D4</p><p><em>(If timed correctly, Reprisal, Feint, and Addle will cover <b>both</b> Mega Holies)</em>.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

After the two Mega Holies, Alexander Prime will then cast "Summon Alexander" before disappearing.

## J Waves

All three bosses will reappear, with Brute Justice landing with a J Storm.

- Cruise Chaser and Alexander Prime will immediately start casting their enrages
- Brute Justice will hit the party with periodic J Wave raid damage roughly each GCD.
- Each J Wave also gives Brute Justice a damage-up stack (max 16).

The party will need to (in order):

1. Defeat Cruise Chaser. *(Cruise Chaser's enrage finishes before Brute Justice's 8th stack.)*
2. Defeat Brute Justice. *(This will allow the party to damage Alexander Prime.)*
3. Defeat Alexander Prime. *(Alexander Prime is invulnerable while BJCC are still around. If you have time, build gauge to prepare for the reopener at Perfect Alexander.)*

As J Waves hit progressively harder, you will need to plan party mitigations accordingly:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After 6 stacks:</b></td>
    <td><p>MT 90s, ST 90s, H1 120s, H2 120s</p><p><em>(This should be around the time Cruise Chaser dies.)</em></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After 8 stacks:</b></td>
    <td><p>ST Reprisal, H2 30s, D2, D3</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After 10 stacks:</b></td>
    <td>Any remaining mitigations</td>
  </tr>
</table>

When Alexander Prime is defeated, a countdown to Divine Judgment will begin. If Alexander did not enrage, this will be survivable with a Tank LB3.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Divine Judgment</b></td>
    <td><p>Tank LB3, H2 shields, H2 30s</p><p><em>(Tank LB3 when the countdown reaches ~4 seconds.)</em>.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The party then proceeds onto Perfect Alexander.
